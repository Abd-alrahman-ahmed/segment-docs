title: System for Cross-domain Identity Management
description: |
  SCIM leverages our new public API to directly connect Segment User Groups to teams defined in our customersâ€™ Identity Providers. This allows our customers to programmatically manage new and existing users.

  This integration programmatically supports:
  1. Provisioning users into a group that is linked to a group in their IdP
  2. Managing group membership in the case of a role or team change
  3. Auto-de-provisioning of users when they are removed from the IdP
