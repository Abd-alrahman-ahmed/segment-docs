title: Twilio's Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)
---

In response to the passage of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) policy in the European Union, Twilio implemented a set of [Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)](https://www.twilio.com/legal/binding-corporate-rules) that inform how Segment stores, processes, and deletes personal data. To align with Twilio's BCRs, Segment introduced a new data deletion process that allows customers to remove all of their users' personal data associated with a workspace 30 days after either deleting their workspace or submitting a written deletion request. 

## What are Binding Corporate Rules?

[Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/binding-corporate-rules-bcr_en) are enforceable, legally binding codes of conduct that explain the ways companies store, process, and delete personal data. These codes contain information about data protection principles, tools used to protect the security of your data, and a method of accountability, or some way that proves the BCRs are externally (outside of the company) and internally (inside of the company) binding.  BCRs are often specific to the storage and transfer (Controller) or processing (Processor) of personal data. 

Twilio has two BCR policies: a [Controller policy](https://www.twilio.com/legal/bcr/controller) and a [Processor policy](https://www.twilio.com/legal/bcr/processor). Segment, as a processor of individual data, complies with the Processor policy.

## What do Twilio's Binding Corporate Rules mean for my data?

Twilio's BCRs inform the way your user data must be stored, processed, and deleted. While the ways Segment stores and processes user data are already in compliance with Twilio's BCRs, [an additional data deletion method](/docs/privacy/account-deletion/#delete-your-workspace-data) for all workspace data was introduced to comply with the ["Storage limitation"](https://www.twilio.com/legal/bcr/processor#part-ii-our-obligations) section of the Processor policy. This new data deletion method, along with the existing methods of deleting [individual user data](/docs/privacy/account-deletion/#delete-individual-user-data) and [source data](/docs/privacy/account-deletion/#delete-data-from-a-source), ensure that Segment's policies now align with Twilio's BCRs.
