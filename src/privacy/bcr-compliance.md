## What are Binding Corporate Rules?

[Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/binding-corporate-rules-bcr_en) are enforceable, legally binding codes of conduct that explain the ways companies store and process personal data. BCRs must be approved by the data protection authority in all European Union member states, as stipulated in [Article 63 of the GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN).

## How can I delete data from my workspace?

To delete all data from your workspace, including customer data:

1. Open the Segment app, and select **Settings.**
2. On the General Settings page, click the **Delete Workspace** button. 
3. Follow the prompts on the pop-up to delete your workspace. 

After you delete your workspace, Segment removes all data associated with your workspace and users immediately in a process called a [complete data purge](#what-is-a-complete-data-purge). 

If you do not manually delete your data after you stop using Segment, it is removed from Segment servers after 30 days. 

<!-- Double check how long the data remains in Segment servers, and how long a complete data purge takes (is it immediate? is it done within 24 hours?) -->

> If you deleted your workspace prior to March 31, 2022, and would like to have data associated with your workspace purged from Segment servers, please reach out to the Deletions and Compliance team [friends@segment.com](mailto:friends@segment.com) with the slug, workplace owner, and nickname of the workspace you would like to have purged from Segment servers.
