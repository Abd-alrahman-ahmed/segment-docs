<!--- note to include: how to find your category ID in tools other than onetrust-->

## Prerequisites

Before you can configure consent in Segment, take the following steps:
- **Access your consent management tool and set up consent categories**. You need a list of your consent categories and the key or ID associated with each topic.
- **Know how your company maps each destination**. You need to know which destinations map to which categories. 
- **Update your web libraries with the consent object**. You need access to your web libraries so you can include the consent object in every event.

<!-- Ask Aaron about consent object order of ops/can it be tested??? Can you undo or pause this?? -->

> error "After adding the consent object to your events, your data is immediately impacted"
> If you disable a consent category, events are not sent to mapped destinations.
>  
> If a destination is mapped to multiple categories, and the end user has conflicting preferences, data will be sent to the destination.
> 
> If Segment receives an API call with both an integrations object and a consent object, the consent object takes preference.

<!-- does this need to be added to multiple pages-->

## Step 1: Create consent categories
