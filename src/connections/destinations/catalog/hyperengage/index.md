## Benefits of Hyperengage (Actions)

Hyperengage (Actions) offers several advantages:

- **Pre-configured Mapping.** We have prebuilt mappings tailored for Hyperengage with all the necessary parameters, reducing the need for manual customization.
- **Direct Data Transfer.** Data moves straight from Segment to Hyperengage, eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries.
- **Event Tracking and User Identification.** With Actions-based destinations, you can keep track of events and identify users and organizations in Hyperengage.
