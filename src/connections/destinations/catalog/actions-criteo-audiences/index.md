Criteo Audiences (Actions) enables advertisers to send Segment Persona Audiences seamlessly to Criteo using Criteo's Audience API.

By leveraging Segment's Persona Audiences with Criteo, you have the opportunity to get traffic and drive conversions from new and existing customer as well as re-engaging existing customers with hyper-relevant ads that promote product discovery.

# Benefits of Criteo Audiences (Actions)

This new integration creates a direct connection between Segment and Criteo for a higher match rate of email identifiers.  

- **Fewer settings**: Unlike our Filter destination, this destination does not require any custom copy and paste code. All that is needed is Advertiser id and Criteo API credentials.

- **Criteo Audience**: creation on the Fly: You do not need a Criteo audience id as the audience gets created on the fly using the Personas audience name. That way audience segment names are consistent across the two platforms Segment and Criteo.

- **Batching events and support for large audiences**: This destination supports batching which enables Criteo to receive large audiences without discrepancies.

- **Near real time audience updates**: Actions destination helps Criteo receive real time events and add or remove users from Criteo audiences appropriately.
