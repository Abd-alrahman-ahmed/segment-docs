## Supported methods

Variance supports the following methods, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Page

```js
analytics.page()
```

Segment sends Page calls to Variance as a `Page` Event Type.


### Screen

Send [Screen](/docs/connections/spec/screen) calls to *ADD WHAT SCREEN CALLS ARE USED FOR HERE*. For example:

```obj-c
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] screen:@"Home"];
```

Segment sends Screen calls to Variance as a `Screen` Event Type.


### Identify

Send [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) calls to *ADD WHAT IDENTIFY CALLS ARE USED FOR HERE*. For example:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to Variance as a `Contact`.


### Track

Send [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track) calls to *ADD WHAT Track CALLS ARE USED FOR HERE*. For example:

```js
analytics.track('Login Button Clicked')
```

Segment sends Track calls to Variance as an `Action` Event Type.


### Group

Send [Group](/docs/connections/spec/group) to Variance. For example:

```js
analytics.group("groupId123", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise"
});
```

Segment sends Group calls to Variance as an `Account` if you've chosen the "Group" Account Mapping method during setup.

## Account Mapping

As mentioned in the setup instructions, Variance offers multiple ways to map your users to accounts or companies. Here's an overview:

1. Group: if you already use the Group call to indicate the Account, then you donâ€™t need to fill in anything. Segment extracts the Account name automatically.
2. Identify with custom traits (for example `company.id` and `company.name`): choose this option if you include some information about the Account, Company, or Organization as a trait in each Identify call. When you choose this option you'll need to add the name of the trait you use. For instance, if you configure the call with the data `{'company':{'id':1,'name':'Awesome Inc.'}}`, add `company.id` as the Account ID trait and `company.name` as the Account Name trait.
3. (Fallback) Identify email trait domain extraction: if you don't use either of the methods above, Segment extracts the domain from the `email` trait and uses that value as the Account name.
