{% include content/plan-grid.md name="data-lakes" %}

The Segment Data Lakes sync history and health tabs generate reports about data syncs so you can monitor the health and performance of your data lakes. These tools provide monitoring and debugging capabilities within the Data Lakes UI, so you can identify and proactively address data sync or data pipeline failures in real time.

## Sync history
The sync history table shows detailed information about the 100 most recent syncs to the data lake. The sync history table includes the following fields:
* **Sync status:** The status of the sync: either 'Success,' where all rows synced correctly, 'Partial Success,' indicating some rows synced correctly, or 'Failed,' where no rows synced correctly
* **Start time:** The time the sync began
* **Duration:** How long the sync took to complete
* **Synced rows:** The number of rows that were synced to the data lake
* **Notices:** Any notes or warnings about the sync

Selecting a row in the sync history table opens a sidebar showing the number of rows that were synced in each collection.

To access the sync history page from the Segment app, open the **My Destinations** page and select the data lake. On the data lakes settings page, select the **Sync History** tab. 

> note ""
> Users cannot select when syncs occur. Syncs occur approximately every two hours.

## Health
The health tab provides an overview of the rows that synced to your data lake both today and each day for the last 30 days. 

The bar chart, 'Daily Synced Rows,' shows an overview of the rows synced for each of the last 30 days. Hovering over a date shows the number of rows that were synced for that day. Selecting a date from the bar chart opens the Daily Row Volume table, which provides a breakdown of which collections synced, how many rows from each collection were synced, and the percentage of all synced rows that each collection represents.

The Daily Row Volume table contains the following information:
* **Collections:** The name for each collection of properties synced to the data lake
* **Rows:** The number of rows synced from each collection
* **% of Total:** The percentage of the total number of rows synced that each collection represents

Above the Daily Row Volume table is an overview of the total syncs for the day, showing the number of rows synced, the number of collections that synced, and the date.

To access the Sync history page from the Segment app, open the **My Destinations** page and select the data lake. On the data lakes settings page, select the **Health** tab.
