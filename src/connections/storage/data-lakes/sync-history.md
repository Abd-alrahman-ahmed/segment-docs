title: Data Lakes Sync History and Sync Health
---
{% include content/plan-grid.md name="data-lakes" %}

Segment generates reports about each sync to your data lake so you can monitor sync performance. The sync health page provides information about trends in volume synced to your data lake over the last 30 days and the sync history provides detailed information about the syncs preformed on the data lake over the last two days. The sync data for both reports updates in real time.

## Sync history
The Sync History table shows detailed information about the most recent syncs to the data lake. The sync history table includes the following fields:
* **Sync status:** The status of the sync: either 'Success,' where all rows synced correctly, 'Partial Success,' indicating some rows synced correctly, or 'Failed,' were no rows synced correctly
* **Start time:** The time the sync began
* **Duration:** How long the sync took to complete
* **Synced rows:** The number of rows that were synced with the data lake
* **Notices:** Any notes about the sync: if no data is synced, the notices column will read "No data found"

To access the Sync history page, open the **My Destinations** page and select the data lake. 

## Sync health
The Sync Health bar chart provides an overview of the volume of rows that synced to your data lake each day for the last 30 days. 

Selecting a bar from the bar chart opens the Daily Row Volume table, which provides a breakdown of which collections synced, how many rows from each collection were synced, and the percentage of all synced rows that each collection of properties represents.
