title: Locate your Write Key
---

The write key is a unique identifier for each Source. It lets Segment know which Source is sending the data, and which destinations should receive that data.

To find a  write key, you first need to create a non-Cloud Source such as a website, server, or mobile source. ([Cloud-sources](/docs/connections/sources/abou![Uploading Screenshot 2023-11-13 at 10.34.20 AM.pngâ€¦]()
t-cloud-sources/) do not have write keys, as they use a token or key from your account with that service.)

Then, in the Source, go to "Settings', and then go to "API Keys".

Now you can add the Source's write key in your app, and begin sending us data.

### How to locate the source by Write Key
To find the source for a write key within your workspace, first navigate to the <b>Connections</b> on the left panel of your workspace. Then on the top right of the screen and select the magnifying glass icon to search your workspace.

Type your write key into the search bar. If the write key exisits in the workspace, it will show up under the search bar with a link to the source.

<b> Please note this function is only available to locate the write key. Using this search to find source ID or destination will not work using this process. </b>
