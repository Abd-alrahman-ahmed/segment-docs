Once you've installed the Analytics React Native library, you can start collecting data through Segment's tracking methods:

- [Identify](#identify)
- [Track](#track)
- [Screen](#screen)
- [Group](#group)
- [Alias](#alias)

### Identify

The [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) method lets you tie a user to their actions and record traits about them. This includes a unique user ID and any optional traits you know about them like their email, name, or address. The traits option can include any information you want to tie to the user. When using any of the [reserved user traits](/docs/connections/spec/identify/#traits), be sure the information reflects the name of the trait. For example, `email` should always be a string of the user's email address.

{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab Method signature %}
```js
identify: (userId: string, userTraits?: JsonMap) => void;
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab Example use %}
```js
const { identify } = useAnalytics();

identify('user-123', {
  username: 'MisterWhiskers',
  email: 'hello@test.com',
  plan: 'premium',
});
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}

### Track
The [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track/) method lets you record the actions your users perform. Every action triggers an event, which also has associated properties that the track method records.

{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab Method signature %}
```js
track: (event: string, properties?: JsonMap) => void;
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab Example use %}
```js
const { track } = useAnalytics();

track('View Product', {
  productId: 123,
  productName: 'Striped trousers',
});
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}

### Screen
The [Screen](/docs/connections/spec/screen/) method lets you record whenever a user sees a screen in your mobile app, along with optional extra information about the page being viewed.

You'll want to record a screen event whenever the user opens a screen in your app. This could be a view, fragment, dialog, or activity depending on your app.

Not all integrations support screen, so when it's not supported explicitly, the screen method tracks as an event with the same parameters.

{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab Method signature %}
```js
screen: (name: string, properties?: JsonMap) => void;
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab Example use %}
```js
const { screen } = useAnalytics();

screen('ScreenName', {
  productSlug: 'example-product-123',
});
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}

For setting up automatic screen tracking, see the [Automatic Screen Tracking instructions](#automatic-screen-tracking).

### Group
The [Group](/docs/connections/spec/group/) method lets you associate an individual user with a groupâ€” whether it's a company, organization, account, project, or team. This includes a unique group identifier and any additional group traits you may know, like company name, industry, or number of employees. You can include any information you want to associate with the group in the traits option. When using any of the [reserved group traits](/docs/connections/spec/group/#traits), be sure the information reflects the name of the trait. For example, email should always be a string of the user's email address.

{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab Method signature %}
```js
group: (groupId: string, groupTraits?: JsonMap) => void;
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab Example use %}
```js
const { group } = useAnalytics();

group('some-company', {
  name: 'Segment',
});
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}

## Utility Methods
The Analytics React Native 2.0 utility methods help you to manage your data. They include:
- Alias
- Reset
- Flush
- Cleanup

### Alias
The [alias](/docs/connections/spec/alias/) method is used to merge two user identities by connecting two sets of user data as one. This method is required to manage user identities in some of Segment's destinations.

{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab Method signature %}
```js
alias: (newUserId: string) => void;
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab Example use %}
```js
const { alias } = useAnalytics();

alias('user-123');
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}

### Reset
The reset method clears the internal state of the library for the current user and group. This is useful for apps where users can log in and out with different identities over time.

> warning ""
> **Note:** Each time you call reset, a new AnonymousId is generated automatically.

{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab Method signature %}
```js
reset: () => void;
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab Example use %}
```js
const { reset } = useAnalytics();

reset();
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}

### Flush
By default, the analytics client sends queued events to the API every 30 seconds or when 20 events accumulate, whichever occurs first. This also occurs whenever the app resumes if the user has closed the app with some events unsent. These values can be modified by the `flushAt` and `flushInterval` config options. You can also trigger a flush event manually.

{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab Method signature %}
```js
flush: () => Promise<void>;
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab Example use %}
```js
const { flush } = useAnalytics();

flush();
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}

### Cleanup
In case you need to reinitialize the client, that is, you've called createClient more than once for the same client in your application lifecycle, use this method on the old client to clear any subscriptions and timers first.

```js
let client = createClient({
  writeKey: 'KEY'
});

client.cleanup();

client = createClient({
  writeKey: 'KEY'
});
```

If you don't do this, the old client instance would still exist and retain the timers, making all your events fire twice.

Ideally, you shouldn't have to use this method, and the Segment client should be initialized only once in the application lifecycle.

## Control upload with Flush Policies
To granularly control when Segment uploads events you can use `FlushPolicies`.
A Flush Policy defines the strategy for deciding when to flush. This can be on an interval, time of day, after receiving a certain number of events, or after receiving a particular event. This gives you more flexibility on when to send event to Segment.
Set Flush Policies in the configuration of the client:
```ts
const client = createClient({
  // ...
  flushPolicies: [
    new CountFlushPolicy(5),
    new TimerFlushPolicy(500),
    new StartupFlushPolicy(),
  ],
});
```
You can set several policies at a time. When a flush occurs, it triggers an upload of the events, then resets the logic after every flush. 
As a result, only the first policy to reach `shouldFlush` will trigger a flush. In the example above either the event count reaches 5 or the timer reaches 500ms, whatever comes first will trigger a flush.
Segment has several standard Flush Policies:
- `CountFlushPolicy` triggers when you reach a certain number of events
- `TimerFlushPolicy` triggers on an interval of milliseconds
- `StartupFlushPolicy` triggers on client startup only

### Adding or removing policies
One of the main advantages of Flush Policies is that you can add and remove policies on the fly. This is very powerful when you want to reduce or increase the amount of flushes. 
For example you might want to disable flushes if you detect the user has no network:
```ts
import NetInfo from "@react-native-community/netinfo";
const policiesIfNetworkIsUp = [
  new CountFlushPolicy(5),
  new TimerFlushPolicy(500),
];
// Create our client with our policies by default
const client = createClient({
  // ...
  flushPolicies: policies,
});
// If Segment detects the user disconnect from the network, Segment removes all flush policies. 
// That way the Segment client won't keep attempting to send events to Segment but will still 
// store them for future upload.
// If the network comes back up, the Segment client adds the policies back. 
const unsubscribe = NetInfo.addEventListener((state) => {
  if (state.isConnected) {
    client.addFlushPolicy(...policiesIfNetworkIsUp);
  } else {
    client.removeFlushPolicy(...policiesIfNetworkIsUp)
  }
});
```
### Creating your own flush policies
You can create a custom Flush Policy special for your application needs by implementing the  `FlushPolicy` interface. You can also extend the `FlushPolicyBase` class that already creates and handles the `shouldFlush` value reset.
A `FlushPolicy` only needs to implement two methods:
- `start()`: Executed when the flush policy is enabled and added to the client. This is a good place to start background operations, make async calls, configure things before execution
- `onEvent(event: SegmentEvent)`: Called on every event tracked by your client
- `reset()`: Called after a flush is triggered (either by your policy, by another policy, or manually)
Your policies also have a `shouldFlush` observable boolean value. When this is set to true the client attempts to upload events. Each policy should reset this value to `false` according to its own logic, although it's common to do it inside the `reset` method.
```ts
export class FlushOnScreenEventsPolicy extends FlushPolicyBase {
  onEvent(event: SegmentEvent): void {
    // Only flush when a screen even happens
    if (event.type === EventType.ScreenEvent) {
      this.shouldFlush.value = true;
    }
  }
  reset(): void {
    // Superclass will reset the shouldFlush value so that the next screen event triggers a flush again
    // But you can also reset the value whenever, say another event comes in or after a timeout
    super.reset();
  }
}
```

## Automatic screen tracking
As sending a screen() event with each navigation action can get tiresome, it's best to track navigation globally. The implementation is different depending on which library you use for navigation. The two main navigation libraries for React Native are [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/){:target="_blank"} and [React Native Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/docs/before-you-start/){:target="_blank"}.

### React Navigation
When setting up React Navigation, you'll essentially find the root level navigation container and call `screen()` whenever the user navigates to a new screen. Segment's [example app](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react-native/tree/master/example){:target="_blank"} is set up with screen tracking using React Navigation, so you can use it as a guide.

To set up automatic screen tracking with React Navigation:

1. Find the file where you used the `NavigationContainer`. This is the main top level container for React Navigation.
2. In the component, create a new state variable to store the current route name:

    ```js
    const [routeName, setRouteName] = useState('Unknown');
    ```
3. Create a utility function for determining the name of the selected route outside of the component:

    ```js
      const getActiveRouteName = (
        state: NavigationState | PartialState<NavigationState> | undefined
      ): string => {
        if (!state || typeof state.index !== 'number') {
          return 'Unknown';
        }

        const route = state.routes[state.index];

        if (route.state) {
          return getActiveRouteName(route.state);
        }

        return route.name;
      };
    ```
4. Pass a function in the `onStateChange` prop of your `NavigationContainer` that checks for the active route name and calls `client.screen()` if the route has changes. You can pass in any additional screen parameters as the second argument for screen calls as needed.

    ```js
    <NavigationContainer
    onStateChange={(state) => {
      const newRouteName = getActiveRouteName(state);

      if (routeName !== newRouteName) {
        segmentClient.screen(newRouteName);
        setRouteName(newRouteName);
      }
    }}
    >
```

### React Native Navigation
In order to set up automatic screen tracking while using [React Native Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/docs/before-you-start/){:target="_blank"}:
1. Use an event listener at the point where you set up the root of your application (for example, `Navigation.setRoot`).
2. Access your `SegmentClient` at the root of your application.

```js      
      // Register the event listener for *registerComponentDidAppearListener*
      Navigation.events().registerComponentDidAppearListener(({ componentName }) => {
        segmentClient.screen(componentName);
      });
```

## Device identifiers
On Android, Segment's React Native library generates a unique ID by using the DRM API as context.device.id. Some destinations rely on this field being the Android ID, so be sure to double-check the destinationâ€™s vendor documentation. If you choose to override the default value using a plugin, make sure the identifier you choose complies with Googleâ€™s User Data Policy. For iOS the context.device.id is set the IDFV.

To collect the Android Advertising ID provided by Play Services, Segment provides a [plugin](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react-native/tree/master/packages/plugins/plugin-advertising-id){:target="_blank"} that can be used to collect that value. This value is set to context.device.advertisingId. For iOS, this [plugin](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react-native/tree/master/packages/plugins/plugin-idfa){:target="_blank"} can be used to set the IDFA context.device.advertisingId property.
