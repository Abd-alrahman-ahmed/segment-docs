title: CX Studio Source
---

[Elastic Path CX Studio](https://www.elasticpath.com/products/cx-studio?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank"} enables you to rapidly launch turn-key storefronts and shoppable landing pages that drive conversion and revenue, without reliance on IT.

This is an [Event Cloud Source](/docs/sources/#event-cloud-sources){:target="_blank"} which can not only export data into your Segment warehouse, but can also federate the exported data into your other enabled Segment Destinations.

This source is maintained by Elastic Path. For any issues with the source, contact the [Elastic Path Support team](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}.

> info ""
> The CX Studio Source is currently in beta, which means that they are still actively developing the source. If you are interested in joining their beta program or have any feedback to help improve the CX Studio Source and its documentation, [let the Elastic Path team know](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us).

## Getting started

1. Navigate to **Connections > Catalog** and make sure you're on the **Sources** tab of the catalog.
2. Search for **CX Studio** in the Sources Catalog, select **CX Studio**, and click **Add Source**.
3. Give the Source a name and configure any other settings.
    - The name identifies this source within your workspace, and typically reflects the name of the application. The name can be anything, but Segment recommends that you use something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (for example, `SourceName_Prod`, `SourceName_Staging`, or `SourceName_Dev`).
4. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
5. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI and [log in to the CX Studio](https://app.unstack.com/login).  
6. Navigate to Settings > Integrations > Select Segment integration, where you need to use Segment key.

## Stream

CX Studio uses our stream Source component to send Segment event data. It uses a client-side (select from `track`, `identify`, `page`, `group`) method(s) to send data to Segment. These events are then available in any destination that accepts client-side events, and available in a schema in your data warehouse, so you can query using SQL.

The default behavior is for CX Studio to pass the `anonymousId` if user is not logged in or pass `userId` if user is logged in. `anonymousId` is nothing but session id generated by CX Studio.

## Events

The table below lists events that CX Studio sends to Segment. These events appear as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in other Destinations.

Note: CX Studio uses properties of these events from the [eCommerce Spec](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2){:target="_blank"} defined by the Segment doc.

## Add destinations

After you configure your source, you can connect it with destinations. Log in to your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties don’t appear, check the Event Delivery tool, and refer to the destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting. If there are any issues with how the events arrive to Segment, contact the [Elastic Path Support team](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}.
