[UserGuiding](https://userguiding.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank”} is a product adoption platform that helps product teams automate in-app experiences that turn new users into champions.


This source is maintained by UserGuiding. For any issues with the source, [contact their Support team](mailto:assist@userguiding.com).

## Getting started

1. From your workspace's [Sources catalog page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog){:target="_blank”} click **Add Source**.
2. Search for "UserGuiding" in the Sources Catalog, select UserGuiding, and click **Add Source**.
3. On the next screen, give the Source a name configure any other settings.

   - The name is used as a label in the Segment app, and Segment creates a related schema name in your warehouse. The name can be anything, but we recommend using something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (eg. UserGuiding_Prod, UserGuiding_Staging, UserGuiding_Dev).

4. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
5. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI.
6. Log in to your UserGuiding account - navigate to Settings > Integrations > Segment Integration and paste the key in the API Key textbox in the *UserGuiding as a source* section to connect.

## Stream

UserGuiding uses a stream Source component to send Segment event data. It uses a server-side `track` method to send data to Segment. These events are then available in any destination that accepts server-side events, and available as a schema in your data warehouse so you can query using SQL.

UserGuiding sends user identifiers in the `user_id` attribute in the event payload. This is the same identifier that is used in the `identify` call to UserGuiding.

## Events

The table below lists events that UserGuiding sends to Segment. These events appear as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in other Destinations. UserGuiding includes the `userId` if available.

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it to Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties don’t appear, check the [Event Delivery](/docs/connections/event-delivery/) tool, and refer to the Destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting.

If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, [contact the UserGuiding support team](mailto:assist@userguiding.com).
