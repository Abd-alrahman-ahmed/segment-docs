title: Elastic Path Source
---

[Elastic Path](https://www.elasticpath.com?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank"} is a SaaS based headless commerce platform that provides core commerce with a focus on catalog & product data management and modern merchandising capabilities so that brands can power their complex commerce experiences across multiple geographies, touchpoints, brands, and business models.

This is an [Event Cloud Source](https://segment.com/docs/sources/#event-cloud-sources){:target="_blank"} which can not only export data into your Segment warehouse, but can also federate the exported data into your other enabled Segment Destinations.

This source is maintained by Elastic Path. For any issues with the source, contact the [Elastic Path's Support team](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}.

## Getting started

1. From your workspace's [Sources catalog page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog){:target="_blank"} click **Add Source**.
2. Search for **Elastic Path** in the Sources Catalog, select **Elastic Path**, and click **Add Source**.
3. On the next screen, give the Source a name configure any other settings.
    - The name identifies this source within your workspace, and typically reflects the name of the application. The name can be anything, but Segment recommends that you use something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (for example, `SourceName_Prod`, `SourceName_Staging`, or `SourceName_Dev`).
4. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
5. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI and log in to Elastic Path Commerce Manager - navigate to Integrations Hub > Select Segment integration > [configure integration](https://elasticpath.dev/docs/composer/integration-hub/customer-management/segment){:target="_blank"} where you need to use Segment key
6. This integration is using JSONata templates to provide flexibility to send your custom fields as well to Segment.
7. In this integration, you can configure that how you want to associate Elastic Path event with Segment event for streaming data e.g. send `Order Completed` event to Segment when Elastic Path order event is `order.paid` or `order.authorized` or if order is fulfilled i.e. `order.fulfilled`.

Note: We are using properties of these events from [eCommerce Spec](https://segment-docs.netlify.app/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2){:target="_blank"} defined by Segment doc. Add more properties as per this documentation based on your business requirement.

## Add destinations

Now that your Source is configured, you can connect it with Destinations. Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties donâ€™t appear, check the Event Delivery tool, and refer to the Destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting. If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, contact the [Elastic Path's Support team](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}.
