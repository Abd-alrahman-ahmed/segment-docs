Subscription groups let your users choose the emails they want to recieve from you. This page introduces subscription groups and explains how you can them with [Engage email campaigns](/docs/engage/campaigns/email-campaigns/).

## About subscription groups

A subscription group let you send emails campaigns to specific groups of users. Subscription groups also give your customers the ability to manage their email preferences, ensuring they only get emails they want to receive.

For example, you may want to create a subscription group that will receive only promotional email campaigns. Should a customer decide to opt out of your promotional campaigns, they'll still be able to receive email campaigns from other subscription groups you've created and to which they've subscribed.

### What your users experience

With subscription groups, your customers can opt in and out of groups on an individual basis instead of unsubscribing from all your campaigns.

Your customers will have the chance to opt in and out of subscription groups on both a subscription preferences page and on the landing page that launches when they unsubscribe.
