Use Trait Activation to configure sync payloads that you send from Engage Audiences to a Destination. Map traits from user profiles to Destinations, configure identifiers to sync, and choose a sync strategy that fits your use cases. 

Trait Activation includes both [Trait Enrichment](/docs/engage/trait-activation/trait-enrichment/) and [ID Sync](/docs/engage/trait-activation/id-sync/). With Trait Enrichment, use custom, SQL, computed, and predictive traits to enrich the data you map to your Destinations. Use ID Sync to select identifiers and a sync strategy for each identifier when syncing Engage Audiences to Destinations.


## Use cases 

Trait Enrichment and ID Sync can help you:

- **Increase match rates in advertising destinations**: Expand the pool of users you advertise to and increase match rates by using more traits and identifiers to find the right customers. 

- **Include more personalized message content**: Use Trait Enrichment to include traits in your payload. This leads to more up-to-date, accurate data that you can use for personalization.

- **Configure how identifiers are sent to destinations**: Send the right identifiers to your destinations. When profiles have multiple identifiers, you can choose the right strategy to select identifiers and send them downstream.
