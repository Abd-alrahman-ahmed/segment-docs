Use Trait Activation to configure sync payloads that you send from Engage Audiences to a Destination. Map traits from user profiles to Destinations, configure identifiers to sync, and choose a sync strategy that fits your use cases. 

Trait Activation includes both [Trait Enrichment](/docs/engage/trait-activation/trait-enrichment/) and [ID Sync](/docs/engage/trait-activation/id-sync/). With Trait Enrichment, use custom, SQL, computed, and predictive traits to enrich the data you map to your destinations. Use ID Sync to select identifiers and a sync strategy for each identifier when syncing Engage Audiences to Destinations.

> info "Trait Activation in beta"
> Trait Activation is in beta, and Segment is actively working on this feature. Some functionality may change before it becomes generally available. [Contact Segment](https://segment.com/help/contact/){:target="_blank"} with any feedback or questions.


## Use cases 

Trait Enrichment and ID Sync can help you:

- **Increase advertising match rates**: Expand the pool of users you advertise to and increase match rates by using traits and identifiers to find the right customers. 

- **Include more personalized message content**: Include traits in your payload for more up-to-date, accurate data. 

- **Configure how you send identifiers to Destinations**: Send the right identifiers to your destinations. For profiles with multiple identifiers, choose a strategy to select identifiers and send them downstream.
