title: Granting Segment Support Access
hidden: true

You can contact Segment Product Support by [submitting a ticket](https://segment.com/help/contact/).

If you submit a particularly tricky ticket to Segment Support Engineer, you may be asked to provide temporary access to your Segment account in order to troubleshoot your issue. Once configured, a Segment Support Engineer will be able to access your account for 7 days - or you can disable Support Access any time.
*Note*: Support Access for workspaces with forced-SSO is not supported at this time.

## Granting a Segment Support Engineer access to your account
Support Access is available for all Segment Workspace Owners and can be found under your Workspace Settings.

Simply click “Grant Access” to allow a Segment Support Engineer to access your account. If you no longer need Support to access your account, simply revoke access at any time

**What can a Segment Support Engineer do in my account?**
A Segment Support Engineer will be able to do everything you can do in your workspace when you grant Support Access.

## How do I know it’s working?

Workspace Owners of Business Tier workspaces can view any Support Access actions in the Audit Trail. You can see and monitor:

- **Support Access Granted** - you have enabled Support Access in your Workspace Settings
- **Support Login** - a Segment Support Engineer has accessed in to your workspace with your account
- **Support Access Revoked**  - you have revoked Support Access from your account
