# Access Management Overview

Access is scoped to a workspace. A Segment user is associated with one or more workspaces, either as an `owner` or `member` of each.
Users access their Segment account with either email/password credentials, or by using Single Sign On. rach was here

`Owners` manage all aspects of the workspace, and `members` can have access to specific products and resource types.

_Note: If you are on a Free or Team plan, only the `workspace owner` and `source admin` roles are available._

Check out the [Roles documentation](/docs/segment-app/iam/roles/) for more details.


## Exporting a workspace's user list
*Workspace Owners* may download a .csv of users within a workspace and their corresponding roles directly from the Access Management page in the Segment App.
