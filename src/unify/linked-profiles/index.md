title: Linked Profiles Overview

---

Use Linked Profiles to expand your model beyond the profile to the entire universe of business data. With Linked Profiles, you can build a [Data Graph](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/data-graph/) that defines relationships between any data set in the warehouse and the Segment Profiles you send with Profiles Sync. 


You can then enrich your event streams with [Linked Events](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/linked-events/) and build audiences off of any data set you've mapped to the data graph with [Linked Audiences](/docs/unify/linked-profiles/linked-audiences/).


Using Linked Profiles, you only need to define the relationships between data sets once in order to give marketers access to all the data you need to target, personalize, and analyze customer experiences.
